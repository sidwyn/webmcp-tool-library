# GFlights WebMCP

A Chrome extension that brings an AI-powered flight assistant into Google Flights. Search, filter, sort, and get booking advice — all in plain English from a side panel.

Built on the [WebMCP](https://github.com/anthropics/webmcp) standard: tools are registered as `window.__webmcpRegistry` entries in the page context and called by the AI as needed.
